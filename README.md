# music-api-js-project
# 'Music preview API' project objective was to acces and get data from music server https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1
#  Data are inserted directly into audio player, the 'next' button works to jump to next file. 
# The search is generic, it's possible to search by artist name, album title or song title, best result is obtained when the input is 'artist name song title'.
# it takes time to get data sometimes from server, need to reclick few times more the button next.
